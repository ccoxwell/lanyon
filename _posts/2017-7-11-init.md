<p>lately, i've been noodling around with arduinos and other boards (primarily adafruit feathers). after about 6 months of not having much direction, i've decided to take on a "real" project. since i am a musician, and the theme of this quarter's <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adabox004">adabox</a> is music, i've decided to make the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/mini-untztrument-3d-printed-midi-controller/overview?gclid=Cj0KCQjwy4zLBRCOARIsADfss34Bt7f76vavOS35XG73KnYvDC3yySMB-5KxPow-F2HtrFuIm5PgYTMaAr7aEALw_wcB">mini untztrument</a>.

once that's put together, i'd like to get a pickup for my violin and use the untztrument as a midi controller.

<p>
a new thing i did today was use my multimeter for the first time to see if my photocell was functioning properly. it was!

hopefully this blog will force me to think critically about what i'm learning and show me how far i've progressed as i move forward.
